Reading the Zola's documentation. It was recommended to use when adding a new theme to the project.\nWith the flow to update, fix, and improve my blog, I had some issues understanding how the submodule works. So, I've decided to create this article with some information. Enjoy.\nWhat is a submodule?\nThe submodule allows you to add another git project inside your project. But why? Have you ever tried to get some project to your project? Probably the approach will be: download the repository (zip file) and unzip your project. If you need to update, you'll do it everything again. Seems like a lot of work, and the submodule will remove for you.\nThis submodule will not be pushed with your commits. And when downloading the project will also download the submodule. The update will be one git command.\nBut it's not just that. You will be able to keep your custom codes in the library, making it easy to merge when a new version comes out.\nAdding a Submodule\nThe command to add a submodule is a simple line:\ngit submodule &lt;url&gt; &lt;name&gt;\n\nOk, you need more information before continuing. The URL is a git endpoint to download the project. And the name is how you want to have this submodule called on your project.\nExample:\ngit submodule https://github.com/gscavalcante/apollo.git themes/apollo\n\nThis execution will create a folder themes/apollo with the content of this repository in the last commit at the root of your project. Since my example have a name separated by a slash (/), it will create a folder with the submodule inside.\n.\n├── README.md\n├── content\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── about.md\n├── sass\n├── static\n├── templates\n└── themes\n    └── apollo\n\n6 directories, 2 files\n\nNow you can use everything from this project on your own.\nAdding From a Branch\nAnother way to add the submodule is with a branch, so it'll not stay at a specific SHA1 when updating. To accomplish this\ngit submodule -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;url&gt; &lt;name&gt;\n\nBut if you already have the submodule added, you can change the .gitmodules file, for example:\n[submodule \"&lt;name&gt;\"]\n    path = &lt;path&gt;\n    url = &lt;url&gt;\n    branch = &lt;branch&gt;\n\nAdd the option branch with the one you want to get this submodule.\nUpdate a Submodule\nUpdate from a remote repository is easy when you track with a branch. For this, run the command below:\ngit submodule update --remote\n\nIf your submodule is not following from a branch, then go back and read Adding From a Branch.\nHow to Delete a Submodule\ngit rm &lt;submodule-name&gt;\n\nBut the old directory will stay at .git/modules/&lt;path-to_submodule&gt;. Delete this folder, and you can download another submodule with the same name without a problem.\nrm -rf .git/modules/&lt;path-to_submodule&gt;\n\n","id":"https://gcavalcante.com/posts/git-submodules-an-overview/","title":"Git Submodules, an Overview"},"https://gcavalcante.com/posts/object-oriented-programming/":{"body":"\nThis article is part of a series about tech interview.\nGo to Tech interview to read more.\n\n⚠️ Since you are here I imagine that have a previous knowledge about programming, and programming language.\nIf you don't know anything about this, maybe this article is not for you yet.\nObject-oriented programming (OOP): an overview\nObject-oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on concept of classes and objects (Nyakundi, 2022).\nThose concepts and the paradigms of OOP will be more explained in details.\nClass vs Object\nWhen we model a problem in terms of objects in OOP, we create abstract definitions representing the types of objects we want to have in our system (Mozilla, n.d.).\nThose abstract definitions is what we call a class.\nLet's imagine that we will create a trading card game (TCG).\nTo make that we need some rules, and those rules are shared between the game.\nOne of those rules are the cards entity, like the example below:\npublic class Card {\n    private final String name;\n    private final String description;\n    private final int attack;\n    private final int defense;\n\n    /*\n        constructor and getters\n    */\n\n    /**\n     * Check if this card is destroyed by the attacker.\n     * \n     * @param Card attacker card\n     */\n    public boolean isDestroyedBy(@NotNull final Card card) {\n        return card.getAttack() &gt; this.defense;\n    }\n}\n\nOk, I know that the Card have those variables and methods.\nKnow I need to instantiate with data from real world.\nvar knightOfKeyboard = new Card(\"Knight of Keyboard\", \"This programmer is a gentleman that always carry her own mechanical keyboard\", 850, 900);\nvar pmOfChaos = new Card(\"Project Manager of Chaos\", \"Where this Project Manager go the place becomes a mess\", 1200, 1000);\n\nif (knightOfKeyboard.isDestroyedBy(pmOfChaos)) {\n    System.out.println(\"Your card was destroyed\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"Your defense is better\");\n}\n\nThose variables with the card is what we call an object.\nTL;DR: Class is a template, containing variables and methods. Object is the instantiated class.\nParadigms of OOP\nNow that you read about the difference between class and objects, it's also important to know some paradigms of OOP.\nInheritance\nOur TCG is going on fire, but the players are talking that we have only character card.\nThey are asking for another type. We will have know two types of cards: character card and app card.\nThey share some variables and methods, but not all.\nTo make simple and don't repeat code, we will use one of the OOP paradigms, the inheritance.\nabstract class Card {\n    private final String name;\n    private final String description;\n\n    /*\n        constructor and getters\n    */\n}\n\nclass CharCard extends Card {\n    private final int attack;\n    private final int defense;\n\n    /*\n        constructor and getters\n    */\n\n    /**\n     * Check if this card is destroyed by the attacker.\n     * \n     * @param Card attacker card\n     */\n    public boolean isDestroyedBy(@NotNull final Card card) {\n        return card.getAttack() &gt; this.defense;\n    }\n}\n\nclass AppCard extends Card {\n    private final int modifier;\n\n    /*\n        constructor and getters\n    */\n\n    /**\n     * Apply modifier at some character card.\n     * \n     * @param Card card thaw will be modified\n     */\n    public void modify(@NotNull final Card card) {\n        // TODO implement\n        \n    }\n}\n\nWith the AppCard we can modify some information at the CharCard.\nBoth of them is a Card.\nWe can say that Card is a superclass or parent class of both CharCard\nand AppCard. Also we can say that CharCard and AppCard are subclasses or\nchild classes of Card.\nWe can shuffle both types at our deck, because both are subclasses of Card.\nEncapsulation\nThis concept we are already using since the first example, let's see again:\nabstract class Card {\n    private final String name;\n    private final String description;\n\n    /*\n        constructor and getters\n    */\n}\n\nSee, we let only the responsible for the data to manipulate that. Only Card\nhave access to the data name. This is what this concept is about.\nEncapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that\ndata within a single unit (Geeks for Geeks, n.d.). We are hiding the\nimplementations details, so the outside can't see how it works, but can interact\nwith the data by methods.\nAbstraction\nThe abstraction concept refers to the process of hiding the internal details,\njust describing things in simple terms.\nWe can take the List for example, we have some methods like add, but we\ndon't know how it is implemented. We jus now that if we call this method sending\nsome data as parameter, this data will be present at the list at the end.\nPolymorphism\nPolymorphism is the concept where an object behaves differently in different situations.\nThere are two ways to achieve that, by overriding, or overloading.\nDifference between Override, and Overload\nOverride means that you will write a new behavior. Occurs on run-time.\nTo understand, let's go back to our card game, let's make a small change to the\nCard class, adding a toString method\nabstract class Card {\n    // ..\n\n    public String toString() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n}\n\nYeap, nothing to drastic, but for the CharCard this is too shallow, we need more\ninformation. To make this, we will Override the toString method.\nclass CharCard extends Card {\n    // ..\n\n    public String toString() {\n        return String.format(\"%s: %d/%d\", name, attack, defense);\n    }\n\n}\n\nEvery call to toString from CharCard will have this new information, but\nthe behavior of Card, or AppCard will be the same, since we didn't changed\nthere.\nBut the overload is different, we can add new methods with the same name, but\ndifferent parameters.\nFor example, we are able to create two different constructors and still valid.\nWe can choose which one we want at different places.\nclass Deck {\n    private final List&lt;Card&gt; cards;\n\n    public Deck() {\n        cards = new ArrayList&lt;Card&gt;;\n    }\n\n    public Deck(List&lt;Card&gt; cards) {\n        this.cards = cards;\n    }\n\n    // getter\n}\n\nAlso, the overload happens at compile-time.\nTL;DR:\n\nOverride: Keep method signature, but change behavior\nOverload: Two or more methods with same name, but different parameters\n\nReferences\n\nNyakundi, Hillay.

It takes time and it's boring to do it every time: you install some software to help you create a bootable USB stick, or follow the commands with the terminal. To solve this, I've discovered Ventoy and it's a lifesaver.\nAfter installing it in one USB drive, I just need to add the ISO to the right partition, and voilà, it's ready!\n\nExample of the selection of ISO when booting through Ventoy:\n\nInstall and update all your programs at once\n\nThis software, called Ninite, is a masterpiece made for Windows OS. It will help you install a lot of software with a single click. You just have to select the programs you want to install and Ninite will create a very small installer file for you.
